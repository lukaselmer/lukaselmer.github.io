{"name":"Lukas Elmer","tagline":"Who I am in 5 minutes","body":"# Hi\r\n\r\n## About me\r\nI am Lukas Elmer and I grew up in Zurich, Switzerland, where I still live. Today, I proudly work as a software engineer at the company I founded together with @diegosteiner: [Renuo](https://www.renuo.ch/).\r\n\r\n## Interests\r\nIn general, I am interested in almost anything, especially in technology, but also in business development and building something new. I love new technologies, diversity and advancements in programming languages and methods, software engineering, and progress in devices (mobile, 3D, computational power, ...), which enable new experiences for end users.\r\n\r\n## Work\r\nDuring work, I like to find pragmatic and simple solutions for complex problems. I expect from myself that I deliver high quality software in time, where the product is useful for our customers. I strongly support the [Manifesto for Agile Software Development](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/) and rely on my teammates to achieve greatness. I believe that only happy developers can result in happy customers, and that multiple people together have better ideas than only a few people sitting in a closed room.\r\n\r\n![Renuo](https://www.renuo.ch/images/logo.png)\r\n\r\n## Studies\r\nDuring my studies at [HSR](https://www.hsr.ch/) (bachelor) and [ETH](https://www.ethz.ch/) (master) in the field of computer science, I created many small tools and projects. I hope that by publishing these contents I can help future students with their coursework, exam preparation or projects. You find everything [here](https://github.com/lukaselmer?tab=repositories). If you are a student at  HSR or ETH, feel free to contact me if you would like to have some additional information or material.\r\n\r\n## Author\r\nLukas Elmer (@lukaselmer).\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\nlukas.elmer@gmail.com","google":"UA-55650672-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
